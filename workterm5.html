                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>My name is Malcolm Wright, and I am a fifth-year computer science student at the University of Guelph. This blog will detail the goals I made for myself, and the plan I made to achieve these desired goals. Furthermore, this blog will go over my role as a Software Engineer intern at Microsoft.</p>
               
                <h2>Employer Information</h2>
                <p>Microsoft Corporation is an American multinational technology company which produces computer software, consumer electronics, and personal computers. Founded in 1975, Microsoft began developing and selling BASIC interpreters for the Altair 8800 and then moved on to MS-DOS. Microsoft Windows followed shortly after. I worked on the Tasks Everywhere team in Office Product Group (OPG), and I also worked closely with the Microsoft Projects team.</p>

                <h2>Goals</h2>
                <h6>Be more vocal with the work I am doing</h6>
                <h6>Go to the office at least 4 times a week</h6>
                <h6>Ask more questions</h6>
                <h6>Use spaced repetition via Anki to recall new knowledge I gain throughout this internship</h6>
                <h6>Continue documenting everything - daily journal, brag docs, tasks</h6>

                <h3>Reflection of goals</h3>
                <p>I'm pleased to share that I've successfully met my set goals, and I am happy with the progress I attained throughout this summer. I've become more vocal about my work, and I regularly went to the office four times a week to engage with my team, my partner team, and interns. On top of that, it got me in a productive mindset which helped me meet my project goals. Goals 3-5 are continual goals, and I am happy with the progress I made this summer. By using spaced repetition with Anki, I've effectively retained new knowledge that can be reviewed in the future. Documenting everything daily, including journaling and updating my brag doc, has helped me track my progress and recall what I did throughout my term since I wrote it down. I can easily search this through my Google Drive which makes it easy for me to find that information. I'm committed to getting even better than I am now, and I’ll ensure these are top of mind during my last year in school and when I start my career.</p>

                <h2>Job Description</h2>
                <p>During this summer, I was engaged in two impactful projects that allowed me to harness my skills and contribute meaningfully to the team's objectives.</p>

                <p>My first project was centered around notifications. I worked on an impact feature that empowers HQ users to determine the recipients of notifications when a tasklist is published or unpublished. This was a full-stack feature which involved a tech stack including C#, Typescript, React, and GraphQL. Through collaboration with my mentor and the rest of my team, I implemented the ability for notifications to be sent to front-line managers, both front-line managers and workers, or no one at all.</p>
                    
                <p>For my second project, I embarked on a different trajectory by creating status reports within a sidecar experience for a project within Microsoft Projects. The status reports were generated using an API called AugLoop which is basically an internal Microsoft ChatGPT which uses GPT3.5 turbo underneath the hood. This endeavor required me to learn more about React flux design pattern, Typescript nuances, and FluentUI. I developed a feature that offered insightful and automated status reports, enhancing the efficiency and transparency of project tracking. They showed the highlights as well as the challenges & risks of a certain project. This second project is part of Microsoft’s Copilot experience across many products. </p>
                
                <p>Balancing these two projects required meticulous time management and prioritization. Navigating between the distinct requirements of each project while delivering quality results was both challenging and rewarding. Moreover, I needed to get up to speed with a total of 3 different codebases: front-end and back-end for my first project and front-end for my second project. This posed as a unique learning opportunity for me as a software engineer. </p>
                    
                <p>To conclude the summer, I had the privilege of delivering two final presentations. These presentations were delivered to the partner director of engineering and Chief Vice Presidents (CVPs) within our organization. It was an invaluable opportunity to showcase the fruits of my labor, share the project outcomes, and receive praise from key stakeholders. </p>
 
                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>In conclusion, the summer has been an enriching journey marked by technical growth and collaborative achievements. The opportunity to work on diverse projects, manage time effectively, and engage with stakeholders through presentations has deepened my skill set and perspective. I extend my heartfelt gratitude to you, the reader, for taking the time to learn about my summer experiences. Here's to continued growth and success ahead!</p>
                <h2>Acknowledgements</h2>
                <p>I would like to express gratitude to my manager, Manesh. Your insightful direction has been instrumental in shaping my professional growth. I am also deeply thankful for the invaluable mentorship provided by Pavan and Dillon. Your wisdom, patience, and willingness to share your expertise have played a pivotal role in my development. Your mentorship has not only enriched my skills but has also inspired me to strive for excellence. Furthermore, I want to extend my sincere appreciation to the entire Tasks Everywhere and Projects teams. The collaborative and dynamic environment you all create has been pivotal in fostering a culture of innovation and accomplishment. I enjoyed the culture that was maintained throughout my summer.</p>
